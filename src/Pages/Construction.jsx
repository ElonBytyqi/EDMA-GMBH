         The construction engineering team has extensive experience in the construction of buildings of different character such as hospital buildings, wastewater treatment buildings, buildings with different uses and many different building profiles. The team works on projects from their initial design conception to completion on site along with architectural teams. They also collaborate with other engineering consultants on projects where knowledge of local codes and third-party procedures can be helpful.
